  <h2 class = "learn-headers">About Rider</h2>
  <p>Your commute is usually about 20 minutes, but your train has stopped at the next station for no reason. Again. You get off and have to formulate a plan of attack by the time you walk up the stairs. How are you getting to work?</p>
  <br>
  <p>Ask Rider. It gives you the cost and estimated time of all your transportation options.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Enter your starting address and your destination address. Tapping Go brings up a list of local travel options from Uber, Lyft, Google Transit and Taxi Fare Finder. So you can order a car, take the train or bus, or call a taxi. The results list the price and the estimated time of arrival for each option.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Rider is designed to work through a browser on your smartphone—tapping the arrow on the results page opens the appropriate app or calls the appropriate company.</p>
  <br>
  <p>If you’re tech-inclined, you’ll be happy to know that Rider is an Angular app calling a separate API designed specifically for it, and you can learn more about <a href="http://farefairy.us">FareFairy</a> on its page. If you’re not, don’t worry: Rider makes travel easy, and that’s all you need to know.</p>
