Rider was created in April of 2016 to help riders find the best travel option in any city.

Simply enter your start and destination locations and click go.

Rider displays the rates and ETAs of Uber, Lyft, local taxis and public transit options in one page.

Click on any of the options to find detailed information about each ride, including surge pricing, car types, taxi phone numbers, or directions to your public transit of choice.
