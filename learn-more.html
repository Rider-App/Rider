  <h2 class = "learn-headers">Our Story</h2>
  <p>Rider was created in April of 2016 as a final project at The Iron Yard, Durham.</p>
  <br>
  <p>When one of our founders was living in New York, traveling around the city took a lot of time out of her day as well as her pocket.  The travel options were there, but the rates and ETAs always varied. Rider was created to show riders the best options out there, and allow them to be in control of their travel experience, anywhere and any time.</p>
  <br>
  <h2 class = "learn-headers">How does Rider work?</h2>
  <p>Simply enter your start and destination locations, and click Go.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Rider displays the lowest rates and shortest ETAs of Uber, Lyft, local taxis and public transit options in one page.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Click on any of the options to find detailed information about each ride, including surge pricing, individual car types and estimates, taxi phone numbers, or directions to your public transit of choice.</p>
